## Install
``` npm i --save @appdevshop/push-service-client ```
## Usage
Import package 
```javascript
import pushService from '@appdevshop/push-service-client'
```   
Initialize client with information about where push-service is running.  
After that you can use your pushService everywhere.  
```javascript
pushService.initialize({ host: 'localhost', port: 1343 }) 
```  
#### Available commands:
You can register firebase token and connect it to some user.  
```javascript  
pushService.register(userToken, firebaseToken)
```  
You can unregister firebase token from some user.  
```javascript  
pushService.unregister(userToken, firebaseToken)
```  
You can send message to some user, using ``` userToken ``` that was use while registering.
```javascript  
pushService.send(userToken, {
    title: 'push title',
    body: 'push text',
    payload: {
        field: 'all addditional info'
    }
})
``` 
``` userToken ``` - some user identificator, string  
``` firebaseToken ``` - firebase token that was send by user and generated by firebase  
  
Or you can create multiple clients for each service:  

```javascript  
const client1 = pushService.createClient({ host: 'localhost', port: 8081 })
const client2 = pushService.createClient({ host: 'localhost', port: 8082 })
```
